Project on Diabetes Readmission for Computational Tools for Data Science Course

This study analyzes hospital readmissions among diabetic patients from 130 US hospitals (1999–2008) using clustering and graph-based methods. Techniques like hierarchical clustering and k-means identified patient subgroups, evaluated through metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin Index. Graph-based community detection, incorporating Random Forest-derived features, revealed patterns in medication use, diagnoses, and readmission rates. While community-aware features modestly enhanced predictive modeling, results highlight the potential of these methods for healthcare analytics and the need for further refinement to
improve insights into readmission drivers.
